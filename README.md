# Spaze Inwaders

A basic little game made with [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/).  
If you're old, you might feel a flicker of nostalgia — if you're young, pretend you're cool retro now.

## 🚀 About

This is a silly, pixelated tribute to the classic *Space Invaders*.  
Blast the aliens. Don’t get blasted. That’s it. No lore, no NFTs, just lasers.

## 🕹️ Controls

- `←` / `→`: Move
- `Space`: Shoot
- `Esc`: Quit (but why would you)

## 🧠 Requirements

- [LÖVE 11.x](https://love2d.org/)
  - Run it with: `love .`

## 📦 How to Run

Clone or download this repo, then:

Or, if you've made a .love file:

love spaze-inwaders.love

## 🎨 Credits
